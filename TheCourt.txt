Okay.
Mr. Mr. Allen?
I believe that- I believe that your case is- was going to be going to trial not this Monday but the following Monday.
Okay.
Do you understand that?
Okay.
I tell you if you needed to tell me something, I want- I'll let you come up here to the podium so you can speak into microphone, and I can hear you.
Uh-huh.
Who are you going to- who are you going to hire?
There isn't- you- you have a right to an attorney.
You don't have a right to a specific attorney.
Well-
He's had doctors at Central State Hospital?
Okay.
I don't- you know, I know Mr. Wyatt pretty well, and I don't think he has the ability to make doctors at Central State do anything.
Well, they may have don it, but I don't think he had anything to do with it.
He- well, I'm
Okay.
Okay.
If you- if you want- if you want the indictment, I'll make sure you get a copy of the indictment.
Uh-huh.
Okay.

Is this a murder?
Okay.
Mr. Wyatt, what dicovery do you have?
You've given him everything you have?
He's given you everything-
Huh?

I think he said he's given you everything that he has.
Well, it may be that he doesn't have that.
I don't know.
Well, you know, you- you-
You've got- you've got-
Well, you've go two choices.
One, you can go to trial with him, or, two, you can try the case yourself.
Now, I definitely, completely think that that's-
Wait a minute.
Listen to me.
That would be the biggest mistake you've ever made in your life.
Now, you have a-
You're probably right. That would be my guess i you try to defend yourself.
You- you don't know anything about selecting a jury, do you?
Do you know anything about cross examining witnesses?
Do you know anything about criminal procedure?
Do you know anything- I'm-
let- let- let me- let me- let-
You know something, I'll be honest, Mr. Allen, I really don't believe that.
I- you know, I-

You can go to trial-
Lis- listn to me.
